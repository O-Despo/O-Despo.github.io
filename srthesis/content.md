## 1 (Title)

Short Text AI sentiment analysis
by Oliver D'Esposito

<!-- Probably wearing my button up computer shirt and sipping out of coding mug

- I will not able to go over everything in the presentation 
- NLP will be skipped  
 -->

## 4 (Topic)

What is the ideal AI model for short text sentiment analysis?

<!--
A pipline is all the methods (code, databases, apis) that Is used in a program

We will get more into this pipline as I get into deffintions
-->

## 3 (Definitions)



## 4 (research methods)

Research Methods

- Google Scholar
- Search Engines
- Documentation
- Blogs

<!-- 
- Code documentation for the tools I was using like TensorFlow
-->


## 3 (Thesis)

Thesis
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the ideal method for sentiment analysis of the short text data when compared to Gradient Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). 

<!-- 
You first question is what? so we will come back to this after I define some things -->

### EXPLAINATION

## 5 (Why this topic)

Why this topic

<!--
- Huge usage and impact
-->

## 5.1 (twitter usage)

5700 tweets per second
192 monetizable daily active users

<!-- 
- This is not even peak usage 2013
- Due to newer polices Twitter no longer publishes this data
- Many issues are discussed on twitter
- Home of news, shopping, commutation, entertainment, controversy
- MDAU is a messure put out in finance reports
 -->

## 5.3 (social impact usage)

#BLM and #Metoo

<!-- 
There was a peak of 8.8 million tweets with teh BLM hashtag in one day
Massive movements on these platforms bring large change
 -->

## 5.4 (Other relivance)

Other uses

- E-Commerce
- Ad campaigns
- Comments
- Hate 

<!-- 
- Think amz basing item position of review sentiment
- Any ad you see the firm wanst to know how it did
- Comments on youtube videos can tell YT how to rank it
- The same research is usefull in blocking hatefull comments
 -->
## 6 (Applied project)

Applied Project

<!--
- First goal collect tweets and use my ai models (I might get to that later)
- Collecting tweets and then doing analyses
- I used tweets b/c twitter is the ideal examples to be tested
  - Emotion heavy
  - Open access
-->

## 6 (Project STEM)

STEM Thesis

<!-- 
- This is a natural STEM thesis
- AI is built out of MATH and CODE project and extra paper space let me explore this technical topic in full
- I am exploring the nuance of different ML models not it societal implications
- It is very grounded
 -->

## 6 (Goals: what I set out to do) 

Goal
Collect and analyze as many Tweets as possible

<!-- 
- Show dependent on single position reliant words b/c therefor CNN
 -->
## 6 (Method: How do you get data)

Pulling Data from twitter
<!-- 
- API licenses
- Every hour pulled tweets from top 20 Trending topics
- Stored in a database
 -->

## 6 (Method: How do you get sentiment data)

How to get sentiment ðŸ¤”

<!-- 
- We could do it by hand
- Took from stanford
- Twitter users classify sentimnet with emojis 
- for each trend - search all happy / sad excluding/ store
 -->

## 6 (Method: How do we train this data)

Information extraction / Training

<!-- 
- Used tensorflow
- Other gerneral python code
- Key words
- Length
 -->

## 6 (New information)

What I learned as a Developer

<!--
Very chalenging
- Hardware faluire
- Realy bad bug
- ISsues with runing on GPU
- Issues with acuracy
-->

## 6 (data examples)

A tweet

<!-- 
Some examples of how I used the data
-->

## 6 (code exmaples)

Show some code

<!--  -->

## 10 (Oposing view Sequtial data)

- complex
- Sequence
<!-- 

Before I get to conclusions
- Some say they are to complex
- Some say sequence is still important
-->
## 6 ( Project Conclusions)

Project conclusions

<!-- These conclusions support my thesis -->

## 6 (Average length/word amount)

Word Count

- Avrg:median
- All 37.6:21
- Happy 33.63:19
- Sad 40.02:22

<!-- 25th percentile 7 words
Shows a tendency for short 
 -->

## 6 (project conclusions)

Project Conclusions

<!-- B/c short and therefor if we can detect is is most likly key words -->

## 7 (Paper conclusion)

CNN is the better model

<!-- 
b/c these tweets are short that importance for sequential understanding dwindles. While need for recognition of position irrelevant words gets more important
 -->

## 9 (Future questions)

- Dialects
- Cultural nuance

<!-- 
How do diffrencet dialects effects this conclusion
Cultural comedy
 -->
