They don&rsquo;t have to take a particular form they just need to be cool. It&rsquo;s my belief that by making this little corner of the internet for me to share my thoughts I will be better motivated to make those cool things. There are no rules here except my own and no expectations except my own. So I think I will be an ideal space to share what I love and do. Often we share ourselves only through the lens of others. There are courses and UMD like <a href=https://github.com/UMD-CS-STICs/389Ospring18>CMSC3890</a> that only function to prepare to market and present yourself, more over resume and CV support and guides are a dime a dozen (<a href=https://careers.umd.edu/find-jobs-internships/resumes-cover-letters/resume-how-to-guide>UMD Resume How-To Guide</a>). There is nothing wrong with this, marketing yourself as an individual is one of the most important skills anyone can have. However, perpetually sharing your work under others&rsquo; constraints, I believe, removes much of the joy of sharing. There is something blatantly refreshing in sharing your work, insights, thoughts, and projects on your own terms. So here I will do just that.</p><p>I also think it is worth noting that writing like this on a regular basis will improve my skills when it comes to technical communications. Hopefully, I will be able to more complete and quickly form meaningful ways to communicate my thoughts. I also think this blog will be good practice for teaching.</p><h2 id=what-i-will-talk-about>What I will talk about</h2><p>For the most part, I expect myself to talk about technical projects (programming, CAD, Linux) but that won&rsquo;t be it. I will also want to speak on topics like time management, music, old technology, accommodations in college, navigating college, research, books, health, and whatever else I want to.</p><h2 id=a-little-intro>A little intro</h2><p>I little about myself, I am a freshman at the University of Maryland College Park. I am a Computer Science major. I am dyslexic and colorblind. Most of my hobbies somehow relate to tech. I have taught programming before. I am the lead engineer for an on-campus startup (<a href=http://sustainabli.us/>Sustaibli</a>). I run dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 11. Hopefully, I have something of interest to share with you, if not enjoy your life.</p></article></div></section><div id=meta><div class=pagelink><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-left"></i>
