As a programmer you build up a stack of tools you like and some you hate. There are no right or wrong answers here this is just what I prefer.
My goal in settings up my environment is to make the process of using my computer efficient and enjoyable.</description></item><item><title>What This Blog Is For</title><link>http://oliverdesposito.com/blog/what-this-blog-is-for/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 16:22:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://oliverdesposito.com/blog/what-this-blog-is-for/</guid><description>Why This is here I want to make cool things. They don&amp;rsquo;t have to take a particular form they just need to be cool. It&amp;rsquo;s my belief that by making this little corner of the internet for me to share my thoughts I will be better motivated to make those cool things. There are no rules here except my own and no expectations except my own. So I think I will be an ideal space to share what I love and do.</description></item></channel></rss>
