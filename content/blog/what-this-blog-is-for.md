## Why This is here

I want to make cool things. They don't have to take a particular form they just need to be cool. It's my belief that by making this little corner of the internet for me to share my thoughts I will be better motivated to make those cool things. There are no rules here except my own and no expectations except my own. So I think I will be an ideal space to share what I love and do. Often we share ourselves only through the lens of others. There are courses and UMD like [CMSC3890](https://github.com/UMD-CS-STICs/389Ospring18) that only function to prepare to market and present yourself, more over resume and CV support and guides are a dime a dozen ([UMD Resume How-To Guide](https://careers.umd.edu/find-jobs-internships/resumes-cover-letters/resume-how-to-guide)). There is nothing wrong with this, marketing yourself as an individual is one of the most important skills anyone can have. However, perpetually sharing your work under others' constraints, I believe, removes much of the joy of sharing. There is something blatantly refreshing in sharing your work, insights, thoughts, and projects on your own terms. So here I will do just that.

I also think it is worth noting that writing like this on a regular basis will improve my skills when it comes to technical communications. Hopefully, I will be able to more complete and quickly form meaningful ways to communicate my thoughts. I also think this blog will be good practice for teaching.

## What I will talk about

For the most part, I expect myself to talk about technical projects (programming, CAD, Linux) but that won't be it. I will also want to speak on topics like time management, music, old technology, accommodations in college, navigating college, research, books, health, and whatever else I want to. 

## A little intro

I little about myself, I am a freshman at the University of Maryland College Park. I am a Computer Science major. I am dyslexic and colorblind. Most of my hobbies somehow relate to tech. I have taught programming before. I am the lead engineer for an on-campus startup ([Sustaibli](http://sustainabli.us/)). I run dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 11. Hopefully, I have something of interest to share with you, if not enjoy your life.
