Mini Mark Zero Sugar was the outcome of asking the question what if I made a markdown parser without a buffer. I did kinda my blog post on the same subject and the read me goes into more detail on the kinda part. I ended up with two things. The first is the [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) inspired markdown zero sugar standard. It has some key limitations most of the syntax is now a length of 2 and things like link references and nested emphasis are not supported. If you want something more useful for real work check out [Common Mark](https://commonmark.org) a great project that defines standard markdown behavior and [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark).
